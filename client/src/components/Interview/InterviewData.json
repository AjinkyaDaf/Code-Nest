          "answer": "OOP in Java is based on four principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, known as a class. Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class. Polymorphism enables objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. Examples include using access modifiers for encapsulation, extending classes for inheritance, and implementing interfaces for polymorphism."
