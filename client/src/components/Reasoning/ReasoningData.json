                "answer": "1/64",
                "explanation": "Each six-sided die has even numbers 2, 4, 6. To find the probability of getting all even numbers, we count the favorable outcome, which is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).

                "answer": "1/50",
                "explanation": "Each twenty-sided die has numbers from 1 to 20. To find the probability of getting a sum greater than 25, we need to count the favorable outcomes. The possible combinations that add up to 25 or less are numerous, so it's easier to count the combinations that add up to 26 or more. There are 175 favorable outcomes out of 20^2 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is 175/400, which simplifies to 7/16. This is equivalent to 1/50 when further simplified."

To find the probability of getting the same number on both rolls, each number on the first roll has a 1/16 chance of matching the same number on the second roll.

The North-South displacement is 40 - 80 = -40 kilometers (negative because it's South). The East-West displacement is 60 kilometers. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the straight-line distance is √((-40)^2 + 60^2) = √(1600 + 3600) = √5200 ≈ 72.11 km.
